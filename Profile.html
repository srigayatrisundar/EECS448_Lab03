Dr. Mikhail Varshavski is auctioning off a date with himself.<br>

A handsome, New York-based doctor with over one million Instagram followers is auctioning himself off for charity in partnership with the dating app, Coffee Meets Bagel. <br>
Dr. Mikhail Varshavski, who goes by the handle Dr. Mike, is a second-year family medicine resident at Overlook Medical Center in Summit, NJ, as well as an entrepreneur and philanthropist.<br>

The 26-year-old Varshavski has model good looks and went viral last year for being People Magazine's "Sexiest Doctor Alive." His Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter were flooded with follows, likes, and comments.<br></p>

<p>Now Varshavski is trying to turn his internet fame to good use by auctioning off a date weekend to one lucky winner — a trip to New York City, a stay in a 4-star hotel, and a dinner at a Michelin-starred restaurant. All donations will go to a charity called The Limitless Tomorrow Foundation, which is Varshavski’s own charity that helps students reach their goals.</p>
